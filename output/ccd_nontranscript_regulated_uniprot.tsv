Q5TA31	RN187_HUMAN	reviewed	RNF187	PTM: Ubiquitinated; undergoes 'Lys-48'-linked autoubiquitination in the absence of growth factors and MAP3K1-induced 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20852630). 'Lys-48'-autoubiquitination leads to degradation by the proteasome, while MAP3K1-induced 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination results in the stabilization of the protein (PubMed:20852630). 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitinations occur most probably on the same 3 C-terminal lysine residues (Lys-195, Lys-223 and Lys-224) and are thus mutually exclusive (PubMed:20852630). Other sites of ubiquitination are not excluded (PubMed:20852630). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by TRIM7 in response to growth factor signaling via the MEK/ERK pathway enhances protein stability (PubMed:25851810). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20852630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25851810}.; PTM: Arginine methylation by PRMT1 stabilizes RNF187 by facilitating K63-linked ubiquitin chain formation, and enables dimerization, c-Jun interaction and subsequent AP1 target gene expression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20852630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23624934}.

Fucosylated repeats can then be further glycosylated by the addition of a beta-1,3-glucose residue by the glucosyltransferase, B3GALTL.

AMPylation occurs in the effector region and leads to inactivation of the GTPase activity by preventing the interaction with downstream effectors, thereby inhibiting actin assembly in infected cells. It is unclear whether some human enzyme mediates AMPylation; FICD has such ability in vitro but additional experiments remain to be done to confirm results in vivo. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19039103, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19362538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20622875}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by SRC in an EGF-dependent manner, this stimulates the binding of the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14506284}.; PTM: (Microbial infection) Glycosylated at Tyr-32 by Photorhabdus asymbiotica toxin PAU_02230.

Different soluble forms are produced by cleavage and autocatalytic cleavage: Atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme, 180 kDa soluble fragment is produced by cleavage by ADAM10, while 160 kDa and 100 kDa soluble fragments are produced by autocatalytic cleavage. Cleavage by ADAM10 to produce soluble 180 kDa soluble fragment takes place after the transmembrane region and before FZ 1.; PTM: A disulfide bond links the activated corin protease fragment and the N-terminal propeptide. The disulfide bond also links the activated corin protease fragment with soluble fragments (100 kDa, 160 kDa and 180 kDa fragments).

Phosphorylation on both Ser-362 and Ser-374 by MAPK1/2 and RSK1/2 leads to protein stabilization with phosphorylation on Ser-374 being the major site for protein stabilization on NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation on Ser-362 and Ser-374 primes further phosphorylations on Thr-325 and Thr-331 through promoting docking of MAPK to the DEF domain. Phosphorylation on Thr-232, induced by HA-RAS, activates the transcriptional activity and antagonizes sumoylation.

P05412	JUN_HUMAN	reviewed	JUN	PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXW7), leading to its degradation (PubMed:14739463, PubMed:27458189). Ubiquitination takes place following phosphorylation, that promotes interaction with FBXW7 (PubMed:14739463). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14739463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27458189}.; PTM: Phosphorylated by CaMK4 and PRKDC; phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity. Phosphorylated by HIPK3. Phosphorylated by DYRK2 at Ser-243; this primes the protein for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3B at Thr-239. Phosphorylated at Thr-239, Ser-243 and Ser-249 by GSK3B; phosphorylation reduces its ability to bind DNA. Phosphorylated by PAK2 at Thr-2, Thr-8, Thr-89, Thr-93 and Thr-286 thereby promoting JUN-mediated cell proliferation and transformation. Phosphorylated by PLK3 following hypoxia or UV irradiation, leading to increase DNA-binding activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14739463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17210646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17804415, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1846781, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650425, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21177766, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22307329, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8464713, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8855261}.; PTM: Acetylated at Lys-271 by EP300. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11689449}.

It is uncertain if SLK phosphorylates all three threonines or one or two of them. PLK1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-179 is essential for its localization in the nuclear envelope, promotes its dissociation from microtubules during early mitosis and positively regulates nuclear envelope breakdown during prophase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20679239, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23985322}.
