1219 proteins that were expressed and exhibited variations in the U-2 OS cell line were selected

present the first evidence of cell cycle association for 234 proteins

Based on this analysis, we identified 321 out of 1219 proteins (26.333059885151762%) to have variance in expression levels temporally correlated to cell cycle progression, and for which the cell-cycle explained 8% or more variance in expression than random.

majority of the proteins analyzed (71.28794093519278%) showed cell-to-cell variations that were largely unexplained by cell cycle progression

Of the 541 proteins (321 in interphase, 230 in mitotic structures, and 10 in both sets) identified to correlate to cell cycle progression, 234 (43.253234750462106%) had a known association to the cell cycle as determined either by a GO BP term ... The remaining 307 proteins (56.746765249537894%),

The patterns of variability were investigated for these 1253 proteins for the population of cells measured for each protein. The mean fold change between the highest and lowest expressing cells per protein was 6.894891834655323.

We determined that 992 proteins (81.37817883511075%) had unimodal intensity distributions, and 227 proteins (18.621821164889255%) were found to display bimodality

Of 43 bimodal samples that were analyzed for cell cycle dependence, 12 were CCD in one cluster (2 of these were CCD when analyzed unimodally), and 2 were CCD in both clusters (2 were also CCD when analyzed unimodally), and the remaining 29 were non-CCD in both clusters.--- RNA pseudotime

We identified 401 genes of 13450 protein-coding genes analyzed (2.9814126394052045%) to have variance in expression levels correlated to cell cycle progression

We can attribute only 14.96881496881497% of proteomic cell cycle regulation to transcriptomic cycling with single-cell RNA sequencing

This includes 86.17021276595744% of known CCD transcripts. Of these, 72 were also cell cycle dependent proteins (14.96881496881497%). Of the 481 CCD proteins, 409 did not have CCD transcripts, including DUSP18 (Figure 2E). There were 28 CCD transcripts that were Non-CCD as proteins.



--- temporal delay

significant delay in peak protein expression compared to transcript expression, 8.557535210526318 hours on average

G1 is the longest period of the cell cycle, in which the majority of RNAs (43.64089775561097%) peak in expression

However, the majority (75.70093457943925%) of the proteins peaked towards the end of the cell cycle corresponding to the S&G2 phases

The delay between peak RNA and protein expression for the 50 CCD proteins that also had CCD transcripts was 8.557535210526318 hrs on average 

this delay indicates that it may take a little less than the same amount of time (3.442464789473682 hrs) to produce a target metabolite after peak expression of an enzyme.
