1426 proteins that were expressed and exhibited variations in the U-2 OS cell line were selected

present the first evidence of cell cycle association for 236 proteins

Based on this analysis, we identified 326 out of 1426 proteins (22.86115007012623%) to have variance in expression levels temporally correlated to cell cycle progression, and for which the cell-cycle explained 8% or more variance in expression than random.

majority of the proteins analyzed (60.72931276297335%) showed cell-to-cell variations that were largely unexplained by cell cycle progression

Of the 546 proteins (326 in interphase, 230 in mitotic structures, and 10 in both sets) identified to correlate to cell cycle progression, 236 (43.223443223443226%) had a known association to the cell cycle as determined either by a GO BP term ... The remaining 310 proteins (56.776556776556774%),

The patterns of variability were investigated for these 1255 proteins for the population of cells measured for each protein. The mean fold change between the highest and lowest expressing cells per protein was 6.890523021660636.

We determined that 995 proteins (69.77559607293128%) had unimodal intensity distributions, and 226 proteins (15.848527349228611%) were found to display bimodality

Of 43 bimodal samples that were analyzed for cell cycle dependence, 12 were CCD in one cluster (2 of these were CCD when analyzed unimodally), and 2 were CCD in both clusters (2 were also CCD when analyzed unimodally), and the remaining 29 were non-CCD in both clusters.
